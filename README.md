# Death Counter Key Listener
This is going to be the Key Listener package that user will run on their PC while playing the game.

Functionality that I want to be able to implement
- Key mapping through JSON
- Passkey settings in JSON.
  - This is going to be a bit iffy, I want to verify how secure this will be.
